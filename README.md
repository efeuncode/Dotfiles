## Welcome to this journey of making your enviroment work for you instead of the other way around.
#### As a compeled Debian user over the years I tried a lot of distributions of Linux but when I first installed Arch finally I see something trully different. I started this journey trying to avoid common desktop enviroments, trying to get out of my confort zone. First stop was Tiling window managers. For convenience I've installed Arcos B extended and click every Tiling WM I knew of: AWSM, I3, Awesome, Qtile, Xmonad, ifhuruefen (I canÂ´t remember how it spells), etc. You get the idea.
#### I started one by one setting a key points to take care and also opening a few youtube videos to see posibilities and hacks about every in particular. I know for sure Arcos linux has a design and config for every desktop, so this could be helpfull in order to start every desktop fast and without troubles. Obviously in Linux is impossible to start without troubles, but you know what I mean.
#### key aspects for me are:
##### - Programming Language in wich is coded
##### - Performance. Ram Consumption *with knowledge about current distro mods* because in order to get fast boots and also get space to run VMs even in old machines.
##### - Key shortcuts
##### - Graphic Design Posibilities
##### - Easy mods and upgradeability (is this a word)

#### So ... This journey is still in process. Currently I have an Awesome Desktop with a custom design and I'm developing a Qtile that I'm more exited because I love to code in python. I've uploaded a first design with some Dracula's theme vibes but more code vibrant. As this journey continue I usually put some extra configs of the apps that I use. At this moment I'm using Qtile fulltime getting the Awesome as a backup when things go sideways.

##### ** Feel free to clone and check my configs for yourself. Always with the disclaimer that for hardware differences or other casualties could go wrong so at your own risk. Always back up your work.
